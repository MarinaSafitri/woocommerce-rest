Justshop wordpress theme

Thank you for purchasing the Justshop theme.

The very first step to be taken now is:
- Please Read index.html file found in Documentation folder , I have made it very concise and to the point.


- Wordpress Theme is in justshop.zip 
- PSD of important pages are in Resrouces/PSD folder.


How to Update the theme:
Note: If you have never updated the wordpress theme before, please message me from my themeforest profile page instead for newbie friendly instruction or you might break your website/changes.
Otherwise , please check update instructions in Documentation folder.


If you want RTL ready version, please also activate a child theme along with justshop.zip, found in Resources/childthemes/justshop-rtl.zip

If you face any problem uploading the theme, that might be because of memory setting of your server, please contact support ( http://templatation.com/support/ ) for help.
